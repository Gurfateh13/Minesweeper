Progress

The group has made quite a lot of headway with the code needed for the game
Minesweaper. We have a class BOARDMAKER which makes the grid of tile 
objects and populates them bases on the user's choices. We also have a way
to create an array that is shuffled with the loctions of the mines/bombs. We
also have a TILE class that is the main ojbect class of Minesweaper. Each
tile can either be empty, or a bomb, or it was have a number for the amount
of bombs it touches. We also have a Main class and a testing class that will
change and evolve as we work on the project. We have also started working 
with GUI's. We were able to create a window with an array of buttons. We 
need to find a way to tie those buttons to tiles and actions.

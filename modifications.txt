modifications

We created an interface for the minesweeper windows to serve as a format. 
We also added a gui that lets the player pick a difficulty. The difficulty
levels that work are easy and medium. We tried to add a hard difficulty but
encountered problems with the array being out of bounds somewhere in the 
Boardmaker class. We also tried to add a leaderboard but couldn't properly 
figure out how to connect it to the gui.
